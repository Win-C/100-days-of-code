# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built Deck of Cards app that cemented understanding of JS asynchronicity using callbacks and async/await. App also focused on CSS formatting and vanilla JS for DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts**:  Pretty comfortable with async and await. Most of efforts were around CSS and formatting; learning about transform and positioning. Still not strong on flexbox (not used) positioning so will continue to focus on CSS in other projects. Also, need to look at other ways to make requests (i.e., Fetch, HTTP.get, etc.), not just using axios.

### Day 2: Friday, April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built Timer app that cemented understanding of built-in React hooks: useState, useEffect and useRef. App handles
- variable states with useState
- side effects with useEffect
- timerId persists across renders with useRef

Timer app counts down from 60 seconds with ability to start/stop and reset the timer. App also focused on CSS formatting. 

**Thoughts**:  Pretty comfortable with useState but still need to continue to practice useEffect and useRef. Still spend considerable time on basic CSS formatting; learning about positioning. Need to continue to play with formatting, possibly returning to this exercise to add a more visually appealing countdown interface and inclusion of hours and minutes.

### Day 3: Saturday, April 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built Pokemon app that refreshed knowledge of props and component design in React.  

**Thoughts**:  Pretty comfortable with using React and basic component design. Will need to practice larger component design breakdown and passing down functions.

### Day 4: Sunday, April 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on Pokemon app adding a Pokemon battle component that generates random hands between two players, calculating a winner based on total experience per hand. Added additional CSS formatting

**Thoughts**:  Still a few CSS formatting follow ups to improve layout. Add Pokemon API calls to generate initial Pokemon list for players, practicing call requests and useEffect hooks.

### Day 5: Monday, April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Focused today on algorithms in JavaScript, practicing using two pointers and reviewing last week's lesson on sliding windows. 

**Thoughts**:  Feeling more confident with sliding windows but still need to practice more problems with multiple pointers. Need to also practice writing out pseudocode steps and multiple cases including edge cases before coding.

### Day 6: Tuesday, April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice algorithms in JavaScript, focusing on applying the two pointers technicque and sliding windows. 

**Thoughts**:  Forgot that variables can be used to store information, incrementing or decrementing as needed (i.e., charMatched variable in anagrams). This was helpful so that only one hashMap was needed to store the char frequency in the anagram pattern. 

**Link(s) to work**: Anagram Strings (https://github.com/Win-C/two-pointers-algos/blob/main/anagrams.js)

### Day 7: Wednesday, April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed understanding of Node's built-in file system module with promises. Built program that can read and write from files and webpages provided in the terminal. 

**Thoughts**:  Continue to be amazed by the power of Node.js and the ability to read and write files. Need to look into ability to write content from multiple sources into a single file. Likely will need to learn the callback API to use the createWriteStream method.
