# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built Deck of Cards app that cemented understanding of JS asynchronicity using callbacks and async/await. App also focused on CSS formatting and vanilla JS for DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts**:  Pretty comfortable with async and await. Most of efforts were around CSS and formatting; learning about transform and positioning. Still not strong on flexbox (not used) positioning so will continue to focus on CSS in other projects. Also, need to look at other ways to make requests (i.e., Fetch, HTTP.get, etc.), not just using axios. 

**Link(s) to work**: Deck of Cards API (https://github.com/Win-C/deck-of-cards)
