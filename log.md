# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built Deck of Cards app that cemented understanding of JS asynchronicity using callbacks and async/await. App also focused on CSS formatting and vanilla JS for DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts**:  Pretty comfortable with async and await. Most of efforts were around CSS and formatting; learning about transform and positioning. Still not strong on flexbox (not used) positioning so will continue to focus on CSS in other projects. Also, need to look at other ways to make requests (i.e., Fetch, HTTP.get, etc.), not just using axios.

### Day 2: Friday, April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built Timer app that cemented understanding of built-in React hooks: useState, useEffect and useRef. App handles
- variable states with useState
- side effects with useEffect
- timerId persists across renders with useRef

Timer app counts down from 60 seconds with ability to start/stop and reset the timer. App also focused on CSS formatting. 

**Thoughts**:  Pretty comfortable with useState but still need to continue to practice useEffect and useRef. Still spend considerable time on basic CSS formatting; learning about positioning. Need to continue to play with formatting, possibly returning to this exercise to add a more visually appealing countdown interface and inclusion of hours and minutes.

### Day 3: Saturday, April 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built Pokemon app that refreshed knowledge of props and component design in React.  

**Thoughts**:  Pretty comfortable with using React and basic component design. Will need to practice larger component design breakdown and passing down functions.

### Day 4: Sunday, April 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on Pokemon app adding a Pokemon battle component that generates random hands between two players, calculating a winner based on total experience per hand. Added additional CSS formatting

**Thoughts**:  Still a few CSS formatting follow ups to improve layout. Add Pokemon API calls to generate initial Pokemon list for players, practicing call requests and useEffect hooks.

### Day 5: Monday, April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Focused today on algorithms in JavaScript, practicing using two pointers and reviewing last week's lesson on sliding windows. 

**Thoughts**:  Feeling more confident with sliding windows but still need to practice more problems with multiple pointers. Need to also practice writing out pseudocode steps and multiple cases including edge cases before coding. 

**Link(s) to work**: Two Pointer Algos (https://github.com/Win-C/two-pointers-algos)

### Day 6: Tuesday, April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice algorithms in JavaScript, focusing on applying the two pointers technicque and sliding windows. 

**Thoughts**:  Forgot that variables can be used to store information, incrementing or decrementing as needed (i.e., charMatched variable in anagrams). This was helpful so that only one hashMap was needed to store the char frequency in the anagram pattern. 

**Link(s) to work**: Anagram Strings (https://github.com/Win-C/two-pointers-algos/blob/main/anagrams.js)

### Day 7: Wednesday, April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed understanding of Node's built-in file system module with promises. Built program that can read and write from files and webpages provided in the terminal. 

**Thoughts**:  Continue to be amazed by the power of Node.js and the ability to read and write files. Need to look into ability to write content from multiple sources into a single file. Likely will need to learn the callback API to use the createWriteStream method. 

**Link(s) to work**: Node file system module (https://github.com/Win-C/node-intro)

### Day 8: Thursday, April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work in Node.js, refreshing knowledge of the environment including Node's interactive REPL. Built program that can randomly generate text based on passed in content. 

**Thoughts**:  Really enjoying building in Node.js and looking forward to follow-on features / build of this program. Will also follow up with tests and maybe a frontend. 

**Link(s) to work**: Markov chain text generator (https://github.com/Win-C/markov-machine)

### Day 9: Friday, April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple goal tracker app using vanilla JS and Bootstrap for some light formatting. Refresh of HTML forms and vanilla JS to manipulate and update the DOM.  

**Thoughts**:  Forgot alot of vanilla JS and forms. This was a good refresh. Lots still left to do for formatting. Need to recall basic CSS for a simple, good layout that can be quickly be built. 

**Link(s) to work**: Simple goal tracker (https://github.com/Win-C/goal-tracker)

### Day 10: Saturday, April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up frontend for fullstack ShareBnB app. Organized React components into separate folders. Fixed navigation bar to show with smaller screen sizes. 

**Thoughts**:  Took awhile to get back up to speed to understand the app. Will focus next couple of days to clean up frontend and use all of the backend routes. Need to also be able to upload and download from AWS S3. Lots of work to do but it will be fun!

**Link(s) to work**: ShareBnB fullstack app (https://github.com/Win-C/sharebnb-frontend)

### Day 11: Sunday, April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to deploy a full stack web app using Heroku for deploying the Flask backend and Surge for deploying the React frontend.

**Thoughts**:  Took awhile to figure things out. Accidentally used cheat sheet for deploying an Express/Node backend using Heroku. Had to use git reset ~Head command to reverse commits. Also, had to include buildpack for Heroku/python. Otherwise, deployment was pretty straight forward.

### Day 23: Friday, April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Tackled binary trees, digging into DFS with recursion. 

**Thoughts**: Taken down by trees... Got stuck storing a global count variable while determining univalue subtrees. Realized that a global variable can be created using a nested recursive function or by making a class. Also, there was no need to create a parent node value variable since the TreeNode class contains the value. 

**Link(s) to work**: Count Num Univalue Trees (https://github.com/Win-C/daily-programming-challenges/blob/main/numUnivalTrees.js)

### Day 24: Saturday, April 24, 2021

**Thoughts**: Need to practice more tree algorithms to make this more intuitive. 

**Link(s) to work**: 
- Dutch National Flag Algorithm (https://github.com/Win-C/daily-programming-challenges/blob/main/dutchNationalFlag.js)

### Day 26: Monday, April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Tackled DP approach and solved straightforward matrix problems today. Again, struggled with DFS recursive tree problem.

**Thoughts**:  DP problems will take longer to learn and need to continue to practice tree problems so that I can solve these within 20-25min for technical interviews. 

**Link(s) to work**: 
- Profitable Job Matching (https://github.com/Win-C/daily-programming-challenges/blob/main/jobMatching.js)

### Day 26: Tuesday, April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: One hour focus on data structures and algorithms: 2 easy and 1 medium problems. 

**Thoughts**:  Got stuck on the problem below. Initially thought it would be a simple sliding window problem but had to result to using a hash table to store sums instead. 

**Link(s) to work**: 
- Number of Sublists with Target Sum (https://github.com/Win-C/daily-programming-challenges/blob/main/numSubListWithTargetSum.js)
